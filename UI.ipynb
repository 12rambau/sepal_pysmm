    "This module runs PYSMM, a python package for creating soil moisture maps. The module can be used to create a time series of soil moisture maps. The estimation of soil moisture is based on a Support-Vector-Regression machine learning approach, training the model based on in-situ data from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) on cross-calibration between Sentinel-1 and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). More information about PYSMM can be found on https://pysmm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
